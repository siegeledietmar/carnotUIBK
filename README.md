# carnotUIBK
MATLAB Simulink Toolbox for creating a thermal building simulation.
Matlab 2018b (for carnotUIBK version up to 2.1.4) and Matlab 2023b (for carnotUIBK version newer than 2.2.0) and the [Toolbox CARNOT](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68890-carnot-toolbox) are required!

Please use the possiblity to follow further updates via GitHub by watching our channel.

## Installation
1. Run the init_carnotUIBK.m to install!
2. Create a working folder (e.g. by copying the TEMPLATE folder!). Don't stay in the carnotUIBK folder!
3. The GUI can be started with start_carnotUIBK.m
4. Load an existing building model or create a new one.
5. Simulate! For the Simulink model please use a model of the TEMPLATE folder. The Simulink model is not automatically created and it is needed to copy it.
6. Modify parameters, modify the HVAC part in the Simulink model.
7. Have fun!
